## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gm <- read_delim("gapminder.csv")
nrow(gm)
ncol(gm)
head(gm,5)
```

We have 13,055 rows and 25 columns. The data that was printed looks good.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  summarise(n_distinct(iso3))
gm %>% 
  summarise(n_distinct(name))
gm %>% 
  summarise(n_distinct(iso2))
```

There are 253 countries in the iso3 section, 250 countries in the name section, and 249 countries in iso2 section.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  group_by(iso2) %>% 
  summarise(name=n_distinct(name)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(name))
gm %>% 
  group_by(iso2) %>% 
  summarise(names=n_distinct(name)) %>% 
  filter(names>1)
```

There is one iso2 country that corresponds to more than one name. However, it is an NA value.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(iso3=n_distinct(iso3)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(iso3))
gm %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(iso3=n_distinct(iso3)) %>% 
  filter(iso3>1)
gm %>% 
  filter(is.na(name)) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(is.na(iso2)) %>% 
  distinct(iso3)
```

Again, there is a name value that corresponds to more than one iso3 value. It is also an NA value.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(time)) %>% 
  summarise(max=max(time),
            min=min(time))
```

The max year is 2019, and the min year is 1960.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarise(missing_data=sum(is.na(co2))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(missing_data))
gm %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarise(missing_data=sum(is.na(co2_PC))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(missing_data))
```
Based off the results form the missing data, it seems that 2017, 2018, and 2019 have the most missing data.
```{r}
country <- c("United States of America", "China","India","Libya","Italy")
gm %>% 
  filter(name %in% country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time,co2,color=name))+
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("CO2 Emissions per Country overtime")
```
Based on this plot, I can see that China contributes to the most CO2 emissions, and Libya to the least. Additionally, China had a large spike around 2000, and it has since been increasing.
```{r}
country <- c("United States of America", "China","India","Libya","Italy")
gm %>% 
  filter(name %in% country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(time,co2_PC,color=name))+
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("CO2 Emissions per Country overtime")
```
From this plot, we can see that the US contributes to the most CO2_PC emissions, and has since 1960. India contributes to the least. Libya had a huge spike around 1975, but it went back down.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  summarise(ave_data=mean(co2_PC))
```
Africa has the least co2 per capita emissions, and countries not part of these major regions have the most co2 per capita emissions.
```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(time == 1960 | time == 2016, !is.na(co2_PC), !is.na(region) ) %>%
  filter(region != "") %>% 
  filter(time %in% c(1960,2016),!is.na(region),!is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  group_by(time,region) %>% 
  summarise(ave_data=mean(co2_PC)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(region,ave_data,fill=as.factor(time)))+
  geom_col(position="dodge")+
    labs(title="Average CO2 Emissions per capita across Continents in 1960 and 2016",
    x="country",
    y="average CO2 per capita")+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Year")
```

```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region),!is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  filter(time==2016) %>% 
  group_by(region,name) %>% 
  summarise(ave_data=mean(co2_PC),.groups="drop") %>% 
  arrange(region,ave_data) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  select(region,name,ave_data) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ave_data)) %>% 
  head(3)
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region),!is.na(co2_PC)) %>% 
  filter(time==2016) %>% 
  group_by(region,name) %>% 
  summarise(ave_data=mean(co2_PC),.groups="drop") %>% 
  arrange(region,ave_data) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  select(region,name,ave_data) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ave_data)) %>% 
  tail(3)
```
The 3 largest countries are Qatar, Trinidad, and Kuwait. The 3 smallest countries are Burundi, Somalia, and DR Congo.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(GDP_PC),!is.na(lifeExpectancy),!is.na(GDP_PC)) %>% 
  filter(time==1960) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GDP_PC,lifeExpectancy,size=totalPopulation,color=region)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7)+
  scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,10))+
  xlab("GDP Per Capita")+
  ylab("Life Expectancy")+
  ggtitle("GDP Per Capita vs. Life Expectancy in 1960")
```
The lower life expectancy in Asia had a higher population and lower GPD PC, and the higher life expectancy in Europe has a lower population and a higher GDP PC.

```{r} 
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(GDP_PC),!is.na(lifeExpectancy),!is.na(GDP_PC)) %>% 
  filter(time==2019) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GDP_PC,lifeExpectancy,size=totalPopulation,color=region)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7)+
  scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,10))+
  xlab("GDP Per Capita")+
  ylab("Life Expectancy")+
  ggtitle("GDP Per Capita vs. Life Expectancy in 2019")
```
In 2019, the only thing that changed for Asia was the higher life expectancy.
These two plots show that the GDP per capita is around the same since the 1960s to 2019.
```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region),!is.na(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  filter(time %in% c(1960,2016)) %>% 
  group_by(time,region) %>% 
  summarise(ave=mean(lifeExpectancy))
```
Yes this matches because life expectancy is higher throughout in this table in 2019 than 1960 which matches the plots.
```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region),!is.na(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  filter(time %in% c(1960,2019)) %>% 
  group_by(region,time) %>% 
  summarise(ave=mean(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  mutate(before=lag(ave),growth=ave-before) %>% 
  arrange(desc(growth))
```
Asia had the biggest growth in life expectancy, and Europe had the smallest growth in life expectancy between 1960 and 2019.

```{r}
gm %>% 
  filter(time==1960|time==2019) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GDP_PC,fill=as.factor(time)))+
  geom_histogram()+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Year")
```

```{r}
gm %>% 
  select(name,time,lifeExpectancy) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name),!is.na(time),!is.name(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  filter(time==1960) %>% 
  mutate(rank=rank(desc(lifeExpectancy))) %>% 
  filter(name=="United States of America")
rank2019<-gm %>% 
  select(name,time,lifeExpectancy) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name),!is.na(time),!is.name(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  filter(time==2019) %>% 
  mutate(rank=rank(desc(lifeExpectancy))) %>% 
  filter(name=="United States of America")
rank2019
```

```{r}
n<-gm %>% 
  select(name,time,lifeExpectancy) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(name),!is.na(time),!is.na(lifeExpectancy)) %>% 
  filter(time=="2019") %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  summarise(n=n_distinct(name))
rank2019$rank/n
```
I spent 4-5 hours on this lab.
